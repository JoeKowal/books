# MyReads Project

This is a book tracking app that keeps track of books you are currently reading, want to read, or have already read.
There is a search functionality that allows you to add new books to any of the categories. To search, click the green "+" in 
the lower right of the screen. A search box will open with the words "Search by title or author". Click in that search box and 
start typing your search. A list of matching books will be displayed, with the option to add any of the books shown to any of your
"bookshelves" {Currently Reading, Want to Read, or Have Already Read}.
You can move the books from one shelf to another on the main app screen by clicking on the green down arrow and viewing your options for book movement. 
Enjoy your new book tracking app!



## Installation Instructions

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* open browser window to localhost:3000



## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend!


## Create React App
